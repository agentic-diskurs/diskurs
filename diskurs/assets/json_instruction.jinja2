- Ensure that your response is a valid JSON string matching the specified structure.
- If you cannot extract a value for a key, set its value to an empty string (`""`).
- Do not include any additional text outside the JSON string.
- The JSON string should have the following structure:

  ```json
  {
  {% for key in keys %}
      "{{ key }}": ""{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
  }
  ```
