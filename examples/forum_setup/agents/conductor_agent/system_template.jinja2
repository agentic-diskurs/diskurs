You are a helpful assistant in a role-playing game.

**Available Roles:**
{% for agent_name, agent_description in agent_descriptions.items() %}
- **{{ agent_name }}**: {{ agent_description }}
{% endfor %}

Your task is to select the most suitable role to continue the conversation based on the conversation so far.

Remember, you should think step-by-step to ensure the best choice.

**Instructions:**
- Analyze the conversation and the roles.
- Decide which role is best suited to continue.
- Return the result as a valid JSON string in the form: `{"next_agent": "role"}`
- **Only return the name of the selected role in a valid JSON string, and nothing else.**
